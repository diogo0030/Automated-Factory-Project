# Automated-Factory-Project

This repository contains the code developed for the Automation Systems (SA) course project in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).

# Project Description

The goal of the project is to program an automated factory that integrates four main operational cells:

- Shipping Cell

- Processing Cell

- Transport Cell

- Separation Cell

Each cell has its specific features and functionalities, which are detailed below.

## Shipping Cell
The shipping cell is responsible for preparing and sending finished products. Its main functionalities include:

Receiving processed products.
Monitoring the shipping status.

## Processing Cell
The processing cell is where products undergo the necessary transformation operations. This cell includes:

A Processing machine.
Managing processing time and sequence for production optimization.

## Transport Cell
The transport cell ensures efficient movement of materials and products between different cells in the factory. 


## Separation Cell
The separation cell functions to classify and separate products according to their final specifications. This cell comprises:

Automatic classification systems.
Sensors to identify product characteristics.
Diverting products to different destinations based on classification.

# Programming Approaches
This repository includes implementations of the automated factory using three different programming approaches:

GRAFCET: A graphical representation for the specification of sequential function charts.
SFC Programming: Sequential Function Chart programming used for modeling complex logic, programmed using CODESYS.
C: Traditional programming language offering fine-grained control over the system.

# Repository Structure

C/: Source code and Factory I/O project files for C implementation.
GRAFCET/: Source code and Factory I/O project files for GRAFCET implementation.
SFC/: Source code and Factory I/O project files for SFC Programming implementation.






This project was developed as part of the Automation Systems course curriculum in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at FEUP. We thank the professors and colleagues for their support and collaboration.
